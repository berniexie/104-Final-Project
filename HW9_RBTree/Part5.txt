Part 5



Part a
1. In order for one hash bucket to be empty, another has bucket must have two elements in its array.This is due to the pigeonhole principle,
if you have m number of keys but only m-1 buckets (since one bucket is empty), one bucket must have at least 2 elements.

2. 
 The probability is ((m-1)/m)^m
 
 3. 
OVERALL Number expected empty locations is m(((m-1)/m)^m)


Part b:
1. k/m probability

2. 

3. 
Expected number of elements in a bucket: n/m or 1
