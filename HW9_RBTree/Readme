The Make command compiles the rb_test.cpp, bst.h and rbbst.h files
To run rb_test.cpp I simply used ./rb_test

The command I used to compile my teams.cpp file is g++ -std=c++11 -o  teams teams.cpp
To run teams.cpp I used ./teams and then included the textfile name.

maptest.cpp was a test file I used for testing some functionality of the unordered map
